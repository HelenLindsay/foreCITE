# foreCITE

**foreCITE** is an R package for performing quality control be**fore** analysing a **CITE**-seq data set.   
It addresses questions such as:
- Did a given antibody work, and does it have a profile similar to that seen in other experiments?
- How much sequencing "read estate" do antibodies take up?

forCITE is a work in progress.  Documentation will be added in the next few weeks.  Feel free to contact me with questions or potential collaborations.
